# Python

Unless noted otherwise, these scripts run in Python 2.7.

## sgfmovedump.py

To run,
```
python sgfmovedump.py <SGF_file> [moves to display]
```

This script needs the package, **[gomill](http://mjw.woodcraft.me.uk/gomill/)**, which can be installed with `pip`.
It is known to work with version 0.7.4.

This script is modified from the *show_sgf.py* script included as an example in the gomill source distribution.
